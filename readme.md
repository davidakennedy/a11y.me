# Accessibility & Me

Just an easy collection of starter files for web projects.

## Why?

Because it's hard finding the right resources to start learning about web accessibility.

## Inspiration and thanks

This wouldn't be possible without these great projects:

* [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
* [HTML5 Bones](http://html5bones.com/)
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [CSS Smart Grid](http://dryan.github.io/css-smart-grid/)
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
