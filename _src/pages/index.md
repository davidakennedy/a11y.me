Welcome to Accessibility (A11y) and Me! Heads up, [a11y is a numeronym for accessibility](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/2017-08-26-a11y-and-other-numeronyms/).

You've heard about this web accessibility thing and know a thing or two. You manage, design or build websites and someone has asked you, "Is your site accessibile?" You're not sure. You hope so! You scour the web to learn more, but discover it's a wild world of contradicting and incomplete information out there when it comes to accessibility.

Where do you start? Right here.

Here you’ll find several useful online resources related to web accessibility and a brief description on how it will help you. The list will always be concise, current and geared toward starting with accessibility or topics within it.
